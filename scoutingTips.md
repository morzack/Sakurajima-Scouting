# Scouting tips

Compiled from Chief Delphi, common sense, and other misc sources

* Make sure to bring a projector to show everybody what is happening
* There is a Chief Delphi scouting sub forum
* Spend time early on ruling out teams that perform poorly and don't put energy into them
* Use the new scouts to focus on basic qualitative data, keep one more experienced person looking at qualitative data
* Often the comments section is most important part
* Electronic scouting seems to be a good way to get a lot of data in quickly
* Forms might not eb the best option, custom app/webpage?
* OPR seems like one of the most accurate/powerful ways of rating teams. Paired with deciding what various teams can do its easilly a good tool
* Don't worry about seeing which of the top teams is better, just look and see who they are
* Match videos!
* 3 categories: don't pick, debate as to whether or not to add to DNP, consider for picking
* Checking improvement after first day is important, that time frame is when it happens
* Maybe only use pit scouting in order to get a general idea of teams. **Match Data Doesn't Lie**
* Keep an eye on position over matches. Maybe use a server to read this data?
* HabLineRobot can be a good way of seeing if a robot is dead or not
* Qualitative data should include durability, drive team skill, wiring, defense, ground hatch
* Have scouts not looking at quantitative data!!! get them to see if robots meet certain criteria (ie, what they do, do they die, how can they stand up to offensive robots)
* Keep an eye on matches, if a match is stacked with cargo bots then it might not be worth considering in the final results/analysis
* OPR seems to be pretty consistent and reliable to analyse this year
* Scout abilities, not matches

## Greater conclusions/ideas

### Scouting

Is it even worth having people do qualitative scouting if the data is on TBA?
Maybe we could have people just track robots and record comments on them.

Definitely since we have a smaller set of people to work with, assign a different ability to each person (note, not a robot) and then have them watch for robbots that have said quality.

### Analysis

Use the HabLineRobot attribute to see if a robot moved.

I should *really* be making sure that I'm looking at [the FRC Events API](https://frcevents2.docs.apiary.io/#reference)

Keep an eye on number of fouls given to each alliance.
