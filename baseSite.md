## Welcome

This is intended to be a scouting application for the 2019 FRC game, Destination Deep Space.
It will contain rankings as well as statistics and graphs for various teams competing at FRC competitions.
Don't expect for it to have to many updates except during competitions.
Hopefully most of this will be auto generated as needed to make things easier for me.

Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/morzack/Sakurajima-Scouting).

Message me at @Valis#7360 on Discord for more information.

## How to interpret this

The OPR recoreded is extremely useful to see what teams are good overall, however it doesn't really give the full picture when it comes to skill.
I'd reccomend pairing the OPR data with qualitative data that determines what it is that a team specializes in.

When interpreting the score graph the easiest thing to look at is the red trendline, as that can show team performance as matches progress.
Obviously a positive slope is good, and any massive dips should be recorded and checked by looking at the OPR.
