# Sakurajima-Scouting

This is intended to be a basic program which will pull scouting data from [TBA's API](https://www.thebluealliance.com/apidocs/v3) and provide simple to understand graphs for people to use.

The things that will probably be taken into consideration are (at least) OPR, Win/Loss ratio, Ranking, and Score

The wrapper that Sakurajima will use is [1418's wrapper](https://github.com/frc1418/tbapy) (installable using `pip install tbapy --user`).
