## Welcome

This is intended to be a scouting application for the 2019 FRC game, Destination Deep Space.
It will contain rankings as well as statistics and graphs for various teams competing at FRC competitions.
Don't expect for it to have to many updates except during competitions.
Hopefully most of this will be auto generated as needed to make things easier for me.

Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/morzack/Sakurajima-Scouting).

Message me at @Valis#7360 on Discord for more information.

## How to interpret this

The OPR recorded is extremely useful to see what teams are good overall, however it doesn't really give the full picture when it comes to skill.
I'd recomend pairing the OPR data with qualitative data that determines what it is that a team specializes in.

When interpreting the score graph the easiest thing to look at is the red trendline, as that can show team performance as matches progress.
Obviously a positive slope is good, and any massive dips should be recorded and checked by looking at the OPR.

The team skill breakdown section will be extremely useful when it comes down to picking teams and seeing what they are capable of doing.
At the moment the only things that will be considered automatically are the climb level and opr.
I don't think that there are any other things that can be automatically determined by just using the TBA API yet.
Sakurajima will probably calculate the score achieved in individual categories at some point using similar math to OPR, but that's not happening yet.
